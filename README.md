I have recently completed my masters in Software Engineer & Database Technologies at the National University of Ireland Galway, and I’ve just moved to Sydney. I have 3 years experience working in the IT sector as a support and installation engineer role with CBE Ltd, one of Irelands leading providers of EPoS solutions.

I am an aspiring software engineer and have experience with Java, Python, C++ , Microsoft SQL, MySQL, AWS and API’s. I have obtained these skills through my university education and work experience to date. I have acquired strong communication and customer relation skills from my previous experience also. 

I am a skilled problem solver who excels in both team and individual settings. I am eager to learn and adapt to different environments.
