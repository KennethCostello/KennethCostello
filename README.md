Hello, I'm Ken, an aspiring software engineer with a diverse skill set and a passion for problem-solving. I have acquired proficiency in Java, Python, C++, SQL, and AWS which I honed during my academic pursuits and my hands-on experience in the field.

I recently earned my master's degree in Software Engineering & Database Technologies from the National University of Ireland Galway and I am retuning home to Ireland after a chapter in Sydney. With over four years of experience in the IT sector, I've gained invaluable insights into the practical aspects of technology implementation and customer relations.

My career is defined by a commitment to continuous learning and adaptability. I thrive in both collaborative team environments and individual challenges, and I bring strong communication skills to every project I undertake.

Beyond my technical capabilities, I'm dedicated to fostering relationships, both personal and professional. I believe in the power of networking and collaboration to achieve remarkable outcomes.

Feel free to reach out and connect. I'm open to new opportunities, collaborations, and conversations.
